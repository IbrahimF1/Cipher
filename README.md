## Overview  
**Cipher** is a cutting-edge data science project leveraging machine learning to detect anomalies in network traffic. By identifying unusual patterns, the model can proactively prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring network security and resilience.  

This repository contains the source code, trained ML model, and related resources for anomaly detection in network traffic data.
